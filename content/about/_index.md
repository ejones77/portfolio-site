Nice to meet you! :wave:

Today, I’m a strategic data lead at Tegus, where my role is centered around its library of interview transcripts between investment analysts and industry experts. I support our compliance operations team in its mission to protect our clients from material nonpublic or otherwise confidential information. 

Much of my day to day involves analytics automation, building workflow tools, and enhancing the company’s surveillance and detection capabilities within the core transcript product.

Before Tegus, I was practicing journalism. And I loved it. I got to interview people with a wide range of experiences, analyze their quotes, and best of all, put the puzzle pieces of a story together. 

But what I really enjoyed was the editing. Not because I liked correcting punctuation, but because it was an ongoing exercise of collaboration and team building. 

It was that passion that led me to be editor in chief, where my professional interests began to shift.  

Whether I was deciding who to hire out of 200 applicants, studying our news coverage to improve diversity and inclusion, or simply figuring out how to report on a global pandemic, I quickly realized I needed data to solve the problems on my plate. Although the problems were difficult, they were very fulfilling to solve. 

So why leave journalism? Well, I spent so much time with these data problems my senior year that by the end of it, I didn’t leave enough room for my own stories. I looked for opportunities that involved editing and research, and that’s where I found Tegus.

I joined as a Compliance Associate, where I would edit and research the factual statements in these transcripts to confirm that everything within them is public information. I became embedded in a complex architecture of policies and procedures that provide crucial safeguards for Tegus clients.

Before long I became invested in solving data problems at Tegus as well. 

In 2022, I started teaching myself how to code in Python. I learned how to design dashboards and query the company’s SQL database.  I gained a new appreciation for statistics, which feeds into my experience with machine learning. It was fun to learn because I could learn by doing and I could realize the potential of these technologies as I was exploring them.

While I enjoyed the impact I was making, I knew I was missing formal training, so I set my sights on Northwestern, where I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science, with a specialization in Data Engineering.

There's still plenty I'm hoping to learn outside the classroom as well, which is why I'm looking to build a portfolio of outside work to further my career in the field.
