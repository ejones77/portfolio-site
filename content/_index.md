Hey,

I’m Evan, I love puzzles, I love learning, and I love developing my career in data science and software development which has no shortage of either. 

As a former news editor turned machine learning engineer, I lead data strategy and software systems for Compliance Operations at Tegus by Alphasense, supporting the company's mission to be the premier destination for investment research through detecting and preventing material nonpublic information from reaching its platform of expert insights. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Northwestern University.
