Hey,

Iâ€™m Evan, I love puzzles, I love learning, and I love developing my career in data science which has no shortage of either. As a former news editor turned data scientist, I lead data strategy for Compliance Operations at Tegus, supporting its mission to be the premier destination for investment research through detecting and preventing material nonpublic information from reaching its platform of expert insights. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Northwestern University.
