Using Pandas, sk-learn, and XGBoost, I trained a series of models to predict Airbnb listing price for a sample of listings in European cities. 

The bulk of the work was put into EDA, feature engineering and feature selection. 

Nine models were tested, including linear regression, random forest, and a neural network.

All in all, the best model was a Random Forest with an RMSE of 84. 



Here are some charts from that project: <br><br>
